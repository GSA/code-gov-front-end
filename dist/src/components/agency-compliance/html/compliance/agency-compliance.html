<h1 id="agencycompliance">Agency Compliance</h1>
<p>
  Agencies are required to perform various tasks in order to satisfy the objectives of the Federal
  Source Code Policy. Currently, agencies are evaluated on whether they've completed three tasks:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Updated agency policy</strong>: Agencies must update their policies to be consistent
    with the Federal Source Code Policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Updated Acquisition Language</strong>: Agencies must update acquisition language to
    capture new custom code whether build by a contractor or federal employee.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Updated Code Inventory</strong>: Agencies must create and update an agency source code
    inventory to be placed online on agency website and Code.gov.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Agencies are evaluated as fully compliant (green), partially compliant (yellow), or non-compliant
  (red) with the tasks outlined above. An agency's overall compliance is green only if they are
  green in all categories.
