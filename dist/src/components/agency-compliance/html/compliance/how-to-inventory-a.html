  of the Source Code Policy require agencies to provide an inventory of their 'custom-developed
  code' to support government-wide reuse and make Federal open source code easier to find.
</p>
<p>
  Using these inventories, <a href="https://Code.gov">Code.gov</a> will provide a platform to search
  federally funded open source software and software available for government-wide reuse.
</p>
<h2 id="publishingyouragencysinventory">Publishing Your Agency's Inventory</h2>
<p>
  Agencies are required to publish their inventories using a standard metadata schema - a JSON file
  that they'll make available on their agency websites. Agencies are strongly encouraged to use
  version 2.0.0 of the schema, which is described below. This version includes revisions that make
  your inventory much more useful and intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  Agencies should make the "code.json" available in the root folder of their website (e.g.,
  https://www.agency.gov/code.json). Code.gov will then retrieve these JSON files daily and compile
  them.
</p>
<h2 id="metadataschemaversion200">Metadata Schema version 2.0.0</h2>
<p>
  The schema fields and definitions are listed below.
  <span class="text-accent-cool-dark" aria-hidden="true"
    >The schema fields marked in blue are optional but recommended as they provide additional,
    helpful information.</span

  Here is
  <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-data/blob/master/schemas/schema-2.0.0.json"
    >version 2.0.0 of the metadata schema file in JSON format</a

  with parent/child relationships.
