<h2 id="cookies">How Code.gov uses Cookies</h2>
<p>
  When you visit a website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a “cookie” to place on
  your device. The cookie, which is unique to your browser, allows the server to “remember” specific
  information about your visit while you are connected.
</p>
<p>
  There are two types of cookies – single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Single
  session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the
  session cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods. Both
  types of cookies create an identifier that is unique to your device. The Office of Management and
  Budget Memorandum M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization
  Technologies, allows Federal entities to use both session and persistent cookies to improve the
  delivery of services.

  Session Cookies: We may use session cookies for technical purposes, such as to allow better
  navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to
  our site. Our use of session cookies qualifies as “Usage Tier 1–Single Session,” as defined in the
  OMB M-10-22 guidance.
</p>
<p>
  Persistent Cookies: We may use persistent cookies to understand the differences between new and
  returning visitors to Code.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your device between visits to our
  site until they expire or are removed by the user. Our use of persistent cookies qualifies as
  “Usage Tier 2–Multi-session without personally identifiable information,” as defined in the OMB
  M-10-22 guidance. The policy states, “This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web
  measurement and customization technologies when no [personally identifiable information] is
  collected.” We do not use persistent cookies to collect personally identifiable information.

  If you do not want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting
  persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
